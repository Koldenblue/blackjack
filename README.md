# Games Websites

## Connect 4
Deployed website can be found at https://koldenblue.github.io/games-websites/. 

Objective: Program games for fun and for coding practice! Websites are programmed using JavaScript/jQuery/HTML/CSS. Object-oriented programming is used. For example, connect 4 coding logic is mainly handled through constructor classes.

Work in progress! The Connect 4 turn structure and game logic is working. For Blackjack, there is basic game structure and deck structure, but no game is programmed (AI, betting, etc.).
