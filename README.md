# Games Websites

Objective: Program games for fun and for coding practice! Websites are programmed using JavaScript/jQuery/HTML/CSS. Object-oriented programming is used. For example, connect 4 coding logic is mainly handled through constructor classes.

Work in progress! Connect 4 turn structure and basic layout works. Blackjack logic works but no game is programmed.
